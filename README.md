To play Tic-tac-toe run the main file spilteori.java which takes no arguments.
Afterwards you will be prompted to write 0, 1 or 2 and then press enter.

If 0 is selected the AI will play against itself.

If 1 is selected the AI will play against you and you will be prompted to press 1 or 0 followed by pressing enter to either select yourself to start or the AI to start.

If 2 is selected you will play against yourself.

Moves are made by clicking on the Jframe which is created when the file is run. 
A game ending move is only announced in the console.
