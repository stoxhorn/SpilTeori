Structurizing main class:

Need a game
	game creeates a board
		board creates fields
	game creates a tree
		tree creates nodes



Bugfixing:
checkwin is fucked

Bugs fixed:
checkWinning() now works, but each move no thinks empty fields are taken already
newmove was dependant on legalmove and not itself, got confused



// Required to visujalize game:



// Done:
runGame()
newGame()
announceEnd()
playerMove()
gameloops
startGame()
legalMove()

toString() for board
