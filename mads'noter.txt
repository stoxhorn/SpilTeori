Fairly sure it's not a fixed depth

No need to name the methods or be so detail-oriented here
Short description of the design/pseudo-code
then do details with examples

Tree creates nodes for each empty field
recursions are done on new children
checks if game is over,
	in which case it assigns a valeu and returns

any way to make code examples smaller?
Maybe have some kind of notation like ^1 to comment specifics

do this throughout all examples

// Describe the design
// Give example
// Describe example

Have code last? otherwise it can be weird to understand
